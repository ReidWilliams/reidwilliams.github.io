      <description>v.3 Here, increasing the amount of peanut butter, and adding salt before &amp;ldquo;fermenting&amp;rdquo;. I read a paper that seemed to suggest that salt improves the enzyme activity of koji.
I&amp;rsquo;m also reducing the amount of koji relative to oats, to make this more about the oats, and try to minimize koji so its just there for the enzymes rather than the rice. (So, doing 1 part koji to 4 parts oats.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been wanting to make the Koji bread from Tartine Book No. 3 for a while now. Where did this come from? I had some Koji sitting in the freezer (probably for too long) from when I first made garum well over a year ago. This past summer, in the middle of the pandemic, I got interested in the Koji again and made some smoked rice amazake that I then made into mouse and ice cream.</description>

      <title>🍞 N°29 — Toasted Sesame</title>
      <link>https://www.reidw.me/entries/bread-29-sesame/</link>

      <description>Recipe v.1 with 25% whole wheat. WW flour is King Author’s “white whole wheat” which is from white instead of red wheat. The scale got messed up while measuring water so I don’t know the hydration level but I’m guessing it’s somewhere +/- 100%.
Added 250 g toasted white sesame seeds. The seeds seemed to soak up water and made the dough feel less hydrated. Either that or dough was moving really fast in the bulk phase and strengthened quickly.</description>

      <description>Thanksgiving was just the three of us, so we ditched turkey and made other things. Mary made a brisket and I made a couple of dishes from the Relæ cookbook, picking ones that were kind of like Thanksgiving sides.
In this one, I dehydrated turnips, then rehydrated and boiled to make it like an al dente pasta. The sauce was an emulsified butter sauce, thickened with xantham, with parsley (which I subbed for the chervil) and horseradish.</description>

      <description>Using recipe v.1 with 25% whole wheat. Giusto’s ultimate performer. Autolyse started at 1:15pm. End of mix at 3:20pm.
Very nice crumb. I used tap water and it worked fine, so no need to use distilled water in the future. Hard and frequent stretch and fold early on.</description>

      <description>Using recipe v.1.
Started autolyse at 9:30am with 25% whole wheat, 75% Giusto’s ultimate performer bread flour, 800 g water. Final hydration was 90%
Mix ended at 1:45pm (so about 4 hours autolyse). I want bulk to take longer today, so using 150g levain instead of 200g and leaving bulk at RT without using oven. Dough temp is around 75°F.
I Lost track of time, so first stretch and fold at 3pm, then 3:30pm, 4:30pm.</description>

      <description>Recipe v.1 with 25% King Arthur whole wheat, 75% Giusto’s ultimate performer (13 - 14.5% protein). The Giusto’s soaks up a lot more water than King Arthur bread flour. 85% hydration, and still very workable. Started autolyse at 11:30am Mixed 5 mins, finished at 1:30pm. 80°F. 3 or so folds every 30 mins Preshaped at 4:55pm. Dough developed faster than in the past, I think because I started the overnight earlier: 1 in 11 around 9pm instead of 11pm per usual.</description>

      <description>Following my recipe v.1 with noted changes. This loaf is:
 33% whole wheat 67% all purpose flour (I ran out of bread flour)  Overnight 1 in 5 levain gets levain ready earlier next day. Started autolyse around 8:30am. Mixed levain and brought up to 80% hydration. Dough felt dry so I kept adding water, maybe too much because it got to about the limit of what was easy to handle (as I found out later during shaping).</description>

      <description>Following my recipe v.1 with noted changes. This loaf is:
 33% whole wheat 9% all purpose flour (because I ran out of bread flour) 67% bread flour  Flour is hard to find, because everyone is baking now that they&amp;rsquo;re at home. Angi bought a 5lb bag of flour that we&amp;rsquo;re splitting.
Overnight levain with starter diluted 1 in 11. Started autolyse at 11am, planned a 2 hour autolyse but it was more like 2.</description>

      <description>80% hydration, 10% whole wheat
Day 1 Night, dilute starter 1 in 5 to start exponential growth. Same next morning.
Day 2 Night, dilute starter 1 in 11 into 100g whole wheat flour + 100g water. This makes just enough for recipe, so separately dilute starter for storage.
Day 3 Mix:
 750g water at 100°F/Users/reidw/repos/made-notebook/content/entries/sourdough-recipe-v.2/index.md 100g whole wheat flour 900g bread flour  Autolyse 1-2 hours covered. Keep temperature at 80° F so that levain goes into dough at 80°.</description>
