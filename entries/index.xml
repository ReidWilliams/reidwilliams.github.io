      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been wanting to make the Koji bread from Tartine Book No. 3 for a while now. Where did this come from? I had some Koji sitting in the freezer (probably for too long) from when I first made garum well over a year ago. This past summer, in the middle of the pandemic, I got interested in the Koji again and made some smoked rice amazake that I then made into mouse and ice cream.</description>

      <description>80% hydration, 10% whole wheat
Day 1 Night, dilute starter 1 in 5 to start exponential growth. Same next morning.
Day 2 Night, dilute starter 1 in 11 into 100g whole wheat flour + 100g water. This makes just enough for recipe, so separately dilute starter for storage.
Day 3 Mix:
 750g water at 100°F/Users/reidw/repos/made-notebook/content/entries/sourdough-recipe-v.2/index.md 100g whole wheat flour 900g bread flour  Autolyse 1-2 hours covered. Keep temperature at 80° F so that levain goes into dough at 80°.</description>
